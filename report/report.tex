\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this project is to simulate an automated vacuum cleaner (AUC). We will represent a room as a 2D plane which has clean and dirty points/tiles. There will also be obstacles in the room such as furniture which would obstruct paths for a vacuum. The goal of the vacuum cleaner is to clear all the dirty points/tiles and navigate/find a path around the obstacles in the room.

In the project we will implement a variety of different vacuums and study its impact on performance. There have been several papers written on the study of automated vacuum cleaners. IRobotâ€™s Roomba is an example of such a robot, we will study this implementation when developing our own algorithms.

\section{Experiment Implementation}

The project implemented 6 distinct vacuum robots. Each Robot has a different set of percepts, and the algorithm is adjusted to deal with it.

The following is a list of the capabilities of each Vacuum robot.
\begin{enumerate}  
\item \textbf{Preloaded Map:} Before the cleaning begins a map of the world is loaded into each the vacuum robot.
\item \textbf{Store explored nodes:} As the vacuum robot moves through the world it is allowed to store with infinite storage the tiles where it has been and the status of that tile
\item \textbf{Dirt Sensor:} A vacuum is allowed to sense the status of the tile that it is currently on.
% are we going to allow it to sense neighbors?
\item \textbf{Proximity Sensor:} the vacuum robot has the ability to know when it is close to a wall.
% assume direct neighbor, but possibly farther?
\end{enumerate}
